1.	Create a program to display odd and even results from 0 to 30. (using ,for loop,while)




2.	Create a program to print the sequence
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 20 = 60




3.	Create a program to display sum of odd and even results find the result and check whether it is odd or even? (Range is 0 to 50)




4.	Create a program to display multiplication table of 5 until the upper limit is 30
And find the even and odd results and also find the count of even or odd results and display at the end. (using do while loop,for loop,while)
5 x 1 = 5
5 x 2 = 10
5 x 30 = 150




5.	Write a program which calculates the sum of all odd numbers upto a particular limit.
The limit will be an input to the program.
Examples:
1. If the limit is 10 then the program should print the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 10
i.e. 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25
So the program should print 25.
2. If the limit is 15 then the program should print sum of odd numbers from 1 to 15
i.e. 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 + 15 = 64
So the program should print 64




6.	Write a program which takes two integers N and M and produces last samples of N of the integers from N-1 to N-M.
for Ex:
1) if user inputs N = 10 M = 4 output will be 9 8 7 6
means it produces last 4 samples from 0 to 10.
2) if user inputs N = 5 M = 2 output will be 4 3




7.	Write a program that takes input array daily temperatures, as floats. and findout the maximum and minimum values.
Example:
1.If array element are: 10.0 11.3 4.5 -2.0 3.6 -3.3 0.0 then the output will be :
Maximum: 11.3
Minimum :-3.3
2.If array element are: 5.0 11.0 12.5 -2.0 3.6 -4.3 9.0 then the output will be :
Maximum: 12.5
Minimum :-4.3



8. Write a program which takes input as integer and display the binary triangle on the basis of input integer.
Example:
1.If user gives input 5 then the binary triangle should be like this :
1
01
010
1010
10101
2.If user gives input 6 then the binary triangle should be like this :
1
01
010
1010
10101
010101


9. Complete the following program which takes the input number then taken the
number to be searched then find outs the number of occurrence of the given input number from that number. to understand better scenario is given below:
Example1:
Enter the number:
43423
Enter number to search:
4
Number of occurence of given number is:
2
Example2:
Enter the number:
43423
Enter number to search:
8
Number of occurence of given number is:
0



10.Write a program which takes input length and width of rectangle as integer and print the rectangle.
Example:
1.If length = 10 and width = 5 then the rectangle is :
**********
*              *
*              *
*              *
**********
1.If length = 15 and width = 10 then the rectangle is :
***************
*                      *
*                      *
*                      *
*                      *
*                      *
*                      *
*                      *
*                      *
***************




11. complete the following program of statement reverse. program will take
string as a input for statement and will print it in reverse form like given below:
example1:
Enter the Statement:
this is programr
Reverse is:
programr is this
example2:
Enter the Statement:
my name is ABC
Reverse is:
ABC is name my



12. A very easy challenge.
Write a program which accepts 3 integers and sort them in ascending order.
For ex :
1) if user input 39 26 28 then output will be 26 28 39.
2) if user input 3934 2426 4628 then output will be 2426 3934 4628.



13. An abundant number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is greater than that number.
the sum of the proper divisors of 12 would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 18,
which means that 12 is an abundant number.
Write a program which accepts input integer as limit upto which it will print Abundant numbers.
For Ex:
1) if user inputs 20 then it should print 12,18,20.
2) if user inputs 40 then it should print 12,18,20,24,30,36,40.



14. Write a program which accepts two integers as a minimum and maximum limit and calculates total of how many 1s were their within the limit.
For ex:
1) if user input 1 11 then it should print 4.
2) if user input 11 111 then it should print 34.


15. Write a program which accepts an integer and print its factors but the factors must be prime.
For ex :
1) if user inputs integer 369.
it should print 3 3 41 as prime factors.
2) if user inputs integer 287.
it should print 7 41 as prime factors.
